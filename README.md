PLC Programming Guide mobile app with an industrial theme. Here's what I included:
Features:
Industrial blue gradient background with dark overlay panels
5 main sections: Basics, Ladder Logic, Instructions, Data Types, and Troubleshooting
Small font titles (16px header, 14px cards, 12-13px content) as requested
1% margins throughout the layout
Expandable cards - tap any card to reveal detailed content
Color-coded elements: Green for tips, orange for warnings, different colors for different instruction types
Code blocks showing PLC syntax and examples
No search bar or 3D elements as requested
The app uses authentic PLC terminology (ladder logic, contacts, coils, timers, counters) and includes practical programming examples. The industrial theme features dark panels, technical aesthetics, and professional color schemes typical of industrial control systems.
